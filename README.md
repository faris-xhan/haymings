# Hayming

 Hayming encodes your data in hamming code.

## How to use it?

 The `encode` route take two query params `data` and `parity`.
 `data` is the original message you want to decode and `parity` is to select the parity of the hamming code. Anything other than 0 would be considered as `Even Parity`. The default parity for the encoding is `Even`.

## Roadmap

- :heavy_check_mark: Add a README
- :black_large_square: Add decoder.
- :black_large_square: Add error checker.
- :black_large_square: Add Home page.
